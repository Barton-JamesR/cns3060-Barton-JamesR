Project 1 - Make
================

James Richard Barton

Ehe.  This one was a bit more fun to do; I believe that I've completed it just fine.  I did make a few assumptions about the instructions; I'm also fairly certain that I verified the more problematic ones (if any) with you ahead of time.

I spent about a half hour hung up on the fact that, when typing 'man cat' into the console, it tells you that it will concatenate stuff; I wasn't sure how to make a simultaneous read/write that wasn't direct in>buffer[]>out, but after looking again, I didn't need one, so... phew.

Again, lemme know if there're any problems or concerns ASAP, and I'll do my best to fix it immediately.

Best regards,
