Project 1 - Make
================

James Richard Barton

Bah.  Best get started with this little bit; no telling when I'll get another chance.
The program itself was troublesome.  The compiler, while not giving me trouble with my 'for' loop, just wouldn't run it, so I used a 'while' instead with roughly the same concept.  It works just as well with only one extra line, so yeah.

Something that threw me was your instruction regarding 'make run'.  Am I supposed to pass 'make run' as an argument?  I assumed that you meant to put that string in whenever it ran, as opposed to changing the input on a blank (or on a specific input...) so I elected to grill you about it when I could.

All in all, it was a good learning experience; I had no prior knowledge of Linux or Git when I started, and my related programming experience was C++/C# only, so I'll be doing a LOT of studying up over the weekend.

I think I did fairly well with it, for a first-time C coder.  Had to look up pretty much everything, and I didn't even KNOW that you could accept command-line arguments directly to a main function like that.  Though after class on Tuesday, I shouldn't have been surprised.  Still, I did fix a bunch of issues with it, and it turned out pretty good, as long as nobody uses apostraphes in their input.
